## About Me
I am Omar Ghassan Abu Deyak, a Software Engineer specialized in Full Stack Web Development. Currently, I am a Full Stack Developer trainee at Orange Coding Academy. I specialize in **React** for Front-End development, **PHP** and **Laravel** for Back-End development, and **Web APIs**.

During my work experience, I have participated in multiple internships and bootcamps, receiving training in various fields. My latest training was as a Full Stack Web Developer at Orange Coding Academy. This intensive bootcamp covered many topics, from the basics of HTML and CSS to advanced topics in React for the Front-End. On the Back-End side, topics such as JavaScript, PHP, Laravel, and MySQL were covered, emphasizing best practices in these technologies. I have built many Full Stack projects from scratch.
